# sdfibm_mionrAdd
SDFIBM MinorAdd extends the original SDFIBM by Chenguang Zhang with new shapes like isosceles triangles and circles composed of them. It also includes utility functions for vector operations. Based on the 2023 release, it works with OFV10. Original src remains unchanged; additions are in New_src.
